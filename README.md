# LAB 4 - NETWORKS

## HOW TO GET STARTED

* Make sure to have node installed (I wrote this using version 17.4)

* ( To check if you have node installed run this command in the terminal `node -V` )

* Once you have node installed, cd into the server folder and run `npm install`. This should download the imported libraries/modules required to run the program.

* Do the same thing for the client folder.

* Once you ran `npm install` in both directories, you are now ready to start the server.

## Starting the Server

* Make sure to be at the root directory of the project. And run `npm start`.

* The server is now running and listening for a connection.

* To connect the client to the server, make sure to open the html file `client.html` in your web-browser of choice. (Make sure you open the file by specifying the file location like below.)
