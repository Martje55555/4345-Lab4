# LAB 4 - NETWORKS

## HOW TO GET STARTED

* Make sure to have node installed (I wrote this using version 17.4)

* ( To check if you have node installed run this command in the terminal `node -V` )

* Once you have node installed, cd into the server folder and run `npm install`. This should download the imported libraries/modules required to run the program.

* Do the same thing for the client folder.

* Once you ran `npm install` in both directories, you are now ready to start the server.

## Starting the Server

* Make sure to be at the root directory of the project. And run `npm start`.

* The server is now running and listening for a connection.

* To connect the client to the server, make sure to open the html file `client.html` in your web-browser of choice. (Make sure you open the file by specifying the file location like below.) Once Succesfully connected, Welcome! should appear on the client side, and New User Connected! should appear in the terminal of the server side. (See Images Below)
