# File Transfer Program

## How to get started

### (Same computer)
*  open two terminals (one for sender & one for receiver)
*  make sure you have a folder named receiver & another one named sender in the same directory as the scripts.
*  make sure you have the file you want to transfer in the sender folder
*  run the sender script first `node sender.js`
*  then in another terminal run the receiver script `node receiver.js`
*  Result should look like below!

### Different Computers
*  same as above but you will have to run the sender script at the receiving computer
*  with a new argumemnt specifying the ip ex. `node receiver.js 1.2.3.4.5'
